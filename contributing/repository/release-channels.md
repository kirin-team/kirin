# Release Channels and Publishing

Kirin has two release channels: `stable` and `canary`.

## Stable

The stable release is what is visible on [kirin.gg](https://kirin.gg).

This channel is published at a regular cadence and follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org).

## Canary

The canary channel has to be explicitly installed, built and self-hosted by users.

This channel is available on the `canary` branch. It holds all changes that are waiting to be published to the stable channel.

`canary` is used to test the latest features and bugfixes.

By using `canary` from time to time you can check if your application is affected by any changes that have not been published yet.
